# Football Team Selection Model

This project aims to develop a predictive model for selecting the best team for a football game based on the potential score of each player. The model utilizes various attributes such as long passing, balance, shot power, agility, strength, and stamina to predict the potential score of players. By assisting football coaches and managers in team selection, this project increases the chances of winning.

## Introduction

Selecting the best team for a football game is crucial for success. This project provides a solution by developing a predictive model that utilizes machine learning techniques to estimate the potential score of each player. By considering various attributes, the model predicts player potential and assists coaches and managers in making informed decisions during team selection.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used in this project:

- Python: The programming language used for implementing the predictive model and data preprocessing.
- Scikit-learn: A popular machine learning library used for implementing the Gaussian Naïve Bayes algorithm.
- NumPy: A library for numerical computing used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Pandas: A data analysis and manipulation library used for data preprocessing and handling datasets.
- Matplotlib: A plotting library used for visualizing data and model evaluation.
- GitHub: The project is hosted on GitHub for version control and collaboration.

## Model Overview

The predictive model is based on the Gaussian Naïve Bayes algorithm. It leverages attributes such as long passing, balance, shot power, agility, strength, and stamina to predict the potential score of each player. To improve model performance, the following techniques were applied:

- Binning: Transforming continuous attributes into discrete bins for better handling of feature distribution.
- Standard Scalar: Scaling the features to have zero mean and unit variance to prevent the dominance of certain attributes.
- Label Encoder: Encoding categorical attributes into numeric values for compatibility with the model.

The model was trained on a labeled dataset, and evaluation metrics were used to assess its performance.

## Getting Started

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/football-team-selection.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the project: `python main.py`

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing plays a crucial role in preparing the dataset for the predictive model. The following preprocessing steps were applied:

- Handling missing values: Missing data was either imputed or dropped depending on the specific attributes and dataset size.
- Binning: Continuous attributes were divided into bins to convert them into discrete categories.
- Standardization: Features were scaled using standard scalar to ensure they have zero mean and unit variance.
- Label Encoding: Categorical attributes were encoded into numeric values for compatibility with the model.

## Model Training

The model was trained using the preprocessed dataset. The training process involved the following steps:

1. Splitting the dataset: The dataset was divided into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance.
2. Model fitting: The Gaussian Naïve Bayes algorithm was applied to the training data to learn the underlying patterns and relationships.
3. Model evaluation: The trained model was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Evaluation

The trained model was evaluated using various evaluation metrics to assess its performance and generalization capabilities. The evaluation metrics used include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves were used to gain deeper insights into the model's performance.

## Usage

To use the predictive model for team selection, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the input data: Collect the attribute values for each player, including long passing, balance, shot power, agility, strength, and stamina.
2. Preprocess the data: Apply the same preprocessing steps used during training, including handling missing values, binning, standard scaling, and label encoding.
3. Use the trained model: Feed the preprocessed data into the trained model to obtain predictions of player potential scores.
4. Select the team: Based on the predicted potential scores, select the players with the highest scores to form the best team for the game.
